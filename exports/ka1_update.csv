Iteration #,Concern,Planned Actions,Expected Learnings,Actual Learnings,Changes for Next Iteration
29,Firefox consuming excessive RAM and slowing system down,Monitor Firefox memory usage over time using top and watch,Identify if there is a memory leak or excessive background processes,Firefox uses 10.9GB of virtual memory and increases over time,Reduce content processes, clear cache, and test in safe mode
28,nvidia-smi is not used with Jetson Orin Nano, alternative GPU monitoring methods needed,Verify GPU availability using tegrastats and direct NVML calls,Ensure Jetson-specific GPU tools are used instead of desktop NVIDIA utilities,nvidia-smi is not present, confirming Orin Nano does not use it,Use tegrastats and NVML API for GPU validation instead of nvidia-smi
27,NVML library symlinked, but nvidia-container-cli --load-kmods info still fails with nvml error: not supported,Verify if NVIDIA runtime is correctly detecting NVML and check ldconfig -p | grep libnvidia-ml,Ensure NVIDIA container runtime recognizes NVML after symlinking,nvidia-container-cli still cannot detect NVML, despite library being in the correct path,Investigate whether NVIDIA runtime requires additional configurations or a specific JetPack 6.0 patch
26,nvidia-container-cli --load-kmods list fails with nvml error: not supported, and no Docker logs exist,Verify NVIDIA runtime compatibility and check if nvml is properly installed with JetPack 6.0,Ensure NVIDIA runtime is able to detect GPU,NVIDIA runtime is not initializing the GPU, and there are no logs in journalctl -u docker,Investigate whether JetPack 6.0 requires a different runtime setup, or if NVML needs to be reinstalled
